**Analytical Reasoning**:
The task involves the completion of 6 STEPS in order.

STEP 1: Extract the x-values (payoffs to Player 1) from each outcome to assess their preferences.
STEP 2: Extract the y-values (payoffs to Player 2) from each outcome to assess their preferences.
STEP 3: Compare payoffs across rows to see if one strategy (row) strictly dominates the other for Player 1.
STEP 4: Compare payoffs across columns to see if one strategy (column) strictly dominates the other for Player 2.
STEP 5: Based on dominance logic, predict each player's chosen strategy.
STEP 6: Determine the outcome where both players follow their dominant strategies.

**Assistant Reasoning**:
STEP 1: Identify Player 1 (p1) payoffs = x-values:
   - (T, L) = 1, (T, R) = 1
   - (B, L) = 0, (B, R) = 0

STEP 2: Identify Player 2 (p2) payoffs = y-values:
   - (T, L) = 1, (T, R) = 0
   - (B, L) = 1, (B, R) = 0

STEP 3: Check row dominance for p1:
   - Compare Top (1, 1) vs. Bottom (0, 0).
   - T dominates B since 1 > 0 for both L and R.

STEP 4: Check column dominance for p2:
   - Compare Left (1, 1) vs. Right (0, 0).
   - L dominates R since 1 > 0 for both T and B.

STEP 5: Player 1 chooses T (dominant). Player 2 chooses L (dominant).

STEP 6: Thus, the equilibrium is at (T, L).
