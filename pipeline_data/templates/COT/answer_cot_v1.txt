**Assistant Reasoning**:
1. Identify Player 1 (p1) payoffs = x-values:
   - (T, L) = 1, (T, R) = 1
   - (B, L) = 0, (B, R) = 0
2. Identify Player 2 (p2) payoffs = y-values:
   - (T, L) = 1, (T, R) = 0
   - (B, L) = 1, (B, R) = 0
3. Check row dominance for p1:
   - Compare Top (1, 1) vs. Bottom (0, 0).
   - T dominates B since 1 > 0 for both L and R.
4. Check column dominance for p2:
   - Compare Left (1, 1) vs. Right (0, 0).
   - L dominates R since 1 > 0 for both T and B.
5. Player 1 chooses T (dominant). Player 2 chooses L (dominant).
6. Thus, the equilibrium is at (T, L).
