Each cell is [x, y].\n- Strict Dominance: A player's strategy strictly dominates another if it yields strictly higher payoff for every possible choice by the other player.\n- Best Response: Given the opponent's fixed strategy, a best response is the strategy that gives the highest payoff to the player in question.\n- Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE): A pair of strategies (one for p1 and one for p2) such that neither player can increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their own strategy.\n- Strategy Notation: p1 uses T or B. p2 uses L or R.\n\n---\n\n\nWe have a 2x2 matrix labeled `combined_matrix`, containing the payoff pairs as follows:\n[ [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]], [[x3, y3], [x4, y4]] ]\n\n- Top-Left cell = (T, L) = [x1, y1]\n- Top-Right cell = (T, R) = [x2, y2]\n- Bottom-Left cell = (B, L) = [x3, y3]\n- Bottom-Right cell = (B, R) = [x4, y4]\n\nHere, x-values correspond to p1, y-values correspond to p2.\nDetermine the pure\u2010strategy NE(s) in the provided `combined_matrix`: [[[6, 9], [8, 8]], [[3, 8], [7, 7]]].\n---\n\n\n1.

Check for Strict Dominance\n   - p1: Compare Top row (x1, x2) to Bottom row (x3, x4). If x1 > x3 and x2 > x4, T strictly dominates B. If x1 < x3 and x2 < x4, B strictly dominates T.\n   - p2: Compare Left column (y1, y3) to Right column (y2, y4). If y1 > y2 and y3 > y4, L strictly dominates R.

Each cell is [x, y].\n- Strict Dominance: A player's strategy strictly dominates another if it yields strictly higher payoff for every possible choice by the other player.\n- Best Response: Given the opponent's fixed strategy, a best response is the strategy that gives the highest payoff to the player in question.\n- Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE): A pair of strategies (one for p1 and one for p2) such that neither player can increase their payoff by unilaterally changing their own strategy.\n- Strategy Notation: p1 uses T or B. p2 uses L or R.\n\n---\n\n\nWe have a 2x2 matrix labeled `combined_matrix`, containing the payoff pairs as follows:\n[ [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]], [[x3, y3], [x4, y4]] ]\n\n- Top-Left cell = (T, L) = [x1, y1]\n- Top-Right cell = (T, R) = [x2, y2]\n- Bottom-Left cell = (B, L) = [x3, y3]\n- Bottom-Right cell = (B, R) = [x4, y4]\n\nHere, x-values correspond to p1, y-values correspond to p2.\nDetermine the pure\u2010strategy NE(s) in the provided `combined_matrix`: [[[3, 1], [2, 10]], [[9, 3], [10, 8]]].\n---\n\n\n1.
